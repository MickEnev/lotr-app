# LOTR React App

This is a React app that uses the "The one API" to retrive infomration about the Lord of The Rings characters, movies, and books. The app then displays this infomration based on button seleciton and displays relevant info for each selection. This is the first project I have made in React and served as an entry point into the framework.
